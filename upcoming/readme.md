# Upcoming seminar topics 

### How do I suggest a new topic?

To suggest a new topic, make an issue with the topic idea and description. 
This should include a title, any relevant material and why you would be interested in this topic.

Once the topic is approved, it will be added to this list and a seminar organizer will ensure the presenter locks in a date.
Then, they can add any relevant materials to this folder to help participants prepare for the upcoming session.

### Who can suggest a new topic?

Anyone, just make an issue!
