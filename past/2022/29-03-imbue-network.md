# Imbue network: a crowdfunding DAO built with Substrate

Sam Elamin, developer and co-founder of Imbue.network will go over a community crowdfunding parachain he and his team have been working on. 
He will share his journey so far in building a system with governance and UX at the core of its design; a code walkthrough of the pallet and a UI demo; challenges and next steps for the project. 
Have a look at the original seminar proposal [here](https://github.com/sacha-l/substrate-seminar/issues/5). 

## Useful context

Some useful inforamtion for those watching the seminar or who plan on attending and want to learn more about the project:

- Imbue Network is a project with grant support by the Web3 Foundation (see [imbue.network](https://www.imbue.network/)
- Check out the Substrate node implementation [here](https://github.com/ImbueNetwork/imbue) 
- Check out the UI walkthrough [demo video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Q61e3x9eEE)
- Check out the [UI codebase](https://github.com/imbuenetwork/dapp)

## Plan 

The overall plan is to talk about the application being built at a high-level and it's purpose, going into depth on design decisions and pallet logic and share insight on key learnings.

### Goals

* To inspire developers to build systems with governance in mind
* Share learnings from building the pallet and front-end application 
* Show demo and share design decisions

### Structure

1. Introduction, including historical context of building this
2. What is Imbue at a high level, why governance is important and what makes Substrate a good fit?
3. Code walkthrough: highlight different dispatchables, storage decisions and protections in place
4. Demo with UI 
5. Next steps, future development plans and improvements 
6. Open Q&A
