# Welcome to the Substrate Seminar repository

A place to discuss topics for upcoming seminars and revisit past ones.

_**NOTE:** This is repo is experimental. Once we see that there is enough interest, we'll make proper templates for posting issues, upload past material and set up the discussion area._
