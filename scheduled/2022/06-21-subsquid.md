## Links and resources

This is [a demo deck](https://hackmd.io/@RaekwonIII/Moonbeam-workshop) I used for a different workshop, I have not prepared one for this seminar, I might make a few changes.

- [Subsquid docs](https://docs.subsquid.io/)
- [Subsquid main GitHub repo](https://github.com/subsquid/squid) and [template repository](https://github.com/subsquid/squid-template), which is the starting point for developers.
- [Subsquid website](https://subsquid.io/) which also offers a [service to host APIs](https://app.subsquid.io/aquarium) created with our SDK
- a couple of examples showing how the SDK can be used:
  - [Crust example](https://github.com/subsquid/squid-crust-example) featured in [this Tutorial](https://docs.subsquid.io/tutorial/create-a-simple-squid) in the docs
  - A [Polkadot Treasury Proposals explorer](https://github.com/subsquid/squid-polkadot-treasury-example)
  - An [example showcasing the support for external APIs calls](https://github.com/subsquid/squid-external-api-example) while processing on-chain data (featuring CoinGecko)
